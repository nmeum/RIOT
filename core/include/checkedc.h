 *
 * @details     If *ENABLE_CHECKEDC* is defined all keywords of the
 *              Checked C language extension are enabled causing code
 *              using them to be compiled with bounds checks. This header
 *              file provides the same macros as the `stdchecked.h`,
 *              with the exception that the macros are ignored when
 *              *ENABLE_CHECKEDC* is not defined and maybe used
 *              differently. For all available keywords refer to
 *              section 2.1 of the Checked C language specification.
